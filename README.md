# Crawler of Exile

The purpose of this project is to crawl the Path of Exile PublicStashes API and persist the results in order to be processed later by other tools.

Not a lot of investment here as even if it took lots of hours to retrieve everything we did not plan to use it again for now.

Base on NodeJS and Express.
